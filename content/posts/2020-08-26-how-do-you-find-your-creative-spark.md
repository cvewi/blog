I've been tasked with an assignment and I'm currently struggling with the one thing that sometimes hit you. A lack of creativity.

I'm no writer, however my job do require me to localize that inner writer inside my self from time to time. At the time of writing this, I should in fact be writing an article for work but I'm struggling.

It's not because I feel like I'm uncomfortable writing about the topic. In fact I have extensive knowledge about this particular topic. I've run projects for clients on this particular topic and I've been working in this field for many years. Somehow it just doesn't seem to flow today. Several questions comes to me:

* Where do I start?
* How should I structure my message?
* What is my message?

I suppose that writing such an article is kids play for professional writers, copywriters or what ever the terminology is. For me however, it's not. 

One of the reasons for this being difficult for me is definitely that I'm not a natural writer. Sure I'm not the worst writer in the world, but definitely not the greatest either. Secondly I'm sure it becomes easier the more you do it (and I really don't do this often). Just like most other skills in this world - the more you practice the better you become.

Some time a go I read Malcom Gladwell's book *"[Outliers](http://wittrup.link/outliers)"* in which he argues that it takes you 10.000 hours of practice to master a skill. Sure some skills come more naturally to some people, but with 10.000 hours of practice you should be able to reach a close to expert level of knowledge in a particular area.

I'm sure I will never reach expert level in writing articles, I struggle to see how I would be able to put in 10.000 hours in to writing during my lifetime. I don't have neither the time or the interest to do so.

...But I will have to start somewhere, so now I will return to my article and hopefully the creativity will flow.
