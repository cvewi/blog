I've been tasked with an assignment and I'm currently struggling with the one thing that sometimes hit you. A lack of creativity.

I'm no writer, however my job do require me to localize that inner writer inside my self from time to time. At the time of writing this, I should in fact be writing an article for work but I'm struggling.

It's not because I don't feel like I'm comftable writing about the topic. In fact I have extensive knowledge about this particular topic. I've run projects for clients on this particular topic. I've been working in this field for many years. But somehow it just doesn't seem to flow today. Several questions comes to me:

* Where do I start?
* How should I structure my message?
* What is my message?

I suppose that writing such an article is kids play for professional writers, copywriters or what ever the terminology is. For me however, it's not.
