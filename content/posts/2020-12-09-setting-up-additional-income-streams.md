I've recently started exploring how to set up additional income streams. I have feeling that I'm too reliant on only one income stream, which can become quite vulnerable. 

During this current pandemic this is really something I have started to consider. Luckily I (or my family) haven't been impacted by the pandemic - economically anyways. However living, working and being in a pandemic really makes you start wondering if you have.

## Passive Income Stream

To address this, I've started looking into how I can set up "passive" income streams, or income streams which at one point may be able to sustain it self with minimal involvement from me. 

I've read many blog posts, articles and guides on setting up niche sites. A niche site is typically a website focusing on a specific niche. On these sites content could be guides, how to's, reviews of products etc..

The idea is of course to position your self on the search engines with SEO (Search Enging Optimization) in order for people to find your content, get an answer to what they are looking for and get on with their day. 

## Monetization of Website

So how would setting up a website correspond to setting up additional income streams?

There are many ways of monetizing a website. Some of the more traditional ones are either using something like [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/), which typically pays you a small amount if somebody clicks on an advertisement that you display on your site.

Another way of monetizing a website is using affiliate marketing. Here one of the biggest players is [Amazon's associate program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/). With affiliate marketing you essential lead your readers to a product of some sorts, where if they end up purchasing this product your will receive a commission. This commission can vary a lot, but usually it's a percentage of the products cost. 

## Next steps

I'm under no illusion that setting up a niche site that will drive passive (or almost passive) income will be an easy task. Also I'm sure that getting to a passive income state is something that will not happen over night. It will require some effort in order to produce the right content, that will allow me to rank in the google searches and for traffic to start flowing into my site. 

But I'm motivated. Motivated to get starting, motivated to reaffirm my financial position by building additional income streams. Motivated to start writing articles.

But before I can get started writing, I will need to find a topic for my site. On [this site](https://www.wittrup.xyz) I plan on documenting my progress. The challenges I, undoubtedly, will face. The successes I, hopefully, will be met with and everything else I'm facing as I move forward with establishing additional income streams.

This is really meant to be tracker to myself, and to keep myself motivated. If I can inspire anybody else along the way, that's only a bonus.
