I've recently started exploring how to set up additional income streams. I have feeling that I'm too reliant on only one income stream, which can become quite vulnerable. 

During this current pandemic this is really something I have started to consider. Luckily I (or my family) haven't been impacted by the pandemic - economically anyways. However living, working and being in a pandemic really makes you start wondering if you have.

## Passive Income Stream

To address this, I've started looking into how I can set up "passive" income streams, or income streams which at one point may be able to sustain it self with minimal involvement from me. 

I've read many blog posts, articles and guides on setting up niche sites. A niche site is typically a website focusing on a specific niche. On these sites content could be guides, how to's, reviews of products etc..

The idea is of course to position your self on the search engines with SEO (Search Enging Optimization) in order for people to find your content, get an answer to what they are looking for and get on with their day. 

## Monetization of Website

So how would setting up a website correspond to setting up additional income streams?
