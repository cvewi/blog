In my [previous post](https://www.wittrup.xyz/posts/2020-12-09-setting-up-additional-income-streams/), I explained how I recently started to look into establishing additional streams of income. During the pandemic I've been considering how to build on my revenue streams in order to position my self with less vulnerability to the an uncertain future. 

I've been thinking quite a lot about how to proceed from here. 

## Getting my plans in place

I'm obviously influenced by my regular job and role. I work as a consultant and project manager, so naturally these skills where some of the skills I turned to when wrapping my head around what I needed to do.

I quickly scanned the marked for a suitable solution to use for organizing my work, activities and tasks. In my job I've used many different tools depending on which client I've worked for, but I saw this as an opportunity to do a mini vendor selection. I wanted a tool which was easy to use and which would be easy to scale, should I at some point have to include anybody else in my work. E.g. if I were to outsource any of my work.

I landed on [ClickUp](http://wittrup.link/clickup) (if you use my link to signup I receive a small commission), a tool that I haven't used before. It really seems to tick all the right boxes at this point. ClickUp makes it super easy to organize your work, tasks and activities. I've set up multiple lists, which can then be viewed as [kanban boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board). This makes it easy to get an overview of things you need to do and how tasks are progressing.

Once I get more familiar with ClickUp I may decide to write a more in depth review of the tool. But so far so good!

## Step 1: Identify Niche

This is something I've spend quite some time on. I've had to find a niche, which I believe I will be able to provide good content to. This is of course easier if you have a natural interest in said niche. I seem to have identified a specific niche now. I will not go into a reveal of the exact niche in this blog post, but can spill the beans a bit. I've selected a niche, which is in the area of home appliances, food and technology. 

It's something I myself is quite interested in, which should make it easier to create content. Before creating a website and purchasing a domain I needed to see if I could identify keywords and potential articles before committing to this.

## Step 2: Identify Keywords

I started out by identifying multiple keywords, which I thought would make for some great content in my selected niche. All of these keywords I've run through several different tools and google to see if I believed there would be room for additional content. There is no point in going into a niche which is already over-satuated by other competitors. 

In terms of tools used for keyword identification, I've used many different options available. The one thing in common across all of them, is that I've only utilized free versions of the tools. At this point I don't think its worth it for me to purchase any tools. First I want to get my feet wet and start producing content.

It's obviously difficult to identify a niche where there is absolutely no competition, however I believe I've found one, where I will be able to compete. 

My keyword research has also resulted in article ideas. All of these ideas I've listed in my "Articles"-list in [ClickUp](http://wittrup.link/clickup). From here it will be smooth sailing, just churning out articles. My initial list is on around 100 articles. There are obviously some overlap between some of the article topics, which is fine, as this can turn in to more in-depth articles. 

With this in place, I feel comfortable in setting up a site and get going.

## Step 3: Domain Name and Setting Up Site

I've purchased a domain through namecheap. Namecheap is also my go-to domain register. It's super easy to buy the domain and set up the dns for my host.

Hosting is done on my existing hosting, where I've simply just added the new domain. At some point I may consider finding a dedicated host for this site, but until some critical mass and monthly impressions have been achieved it should be fine with what I already have.

In terms of finding the right domain name, I've used [Nameboy](https://www.nameboy.com/) to get the creativity going with different suggestions in that would be relevant for my niche. I've decided on going with a domain name that contains the primary key word I'm targeting, but is also a play on other words. 

I think this makes the name quite brandable, let's see if that is true.

In terms of setup of the site, I've gone with a wordpress solution. Not because I'm necessarily a big fan of wordpress, but it does make it super easy to set up a niche site. I've utilized an existing theme and tailored it to my needs with different plugins that should make the content creation easier.

For SEO I've set up RankMath. For tracking I'm running Google Analytics, and ThristyAffliates. To cope with some of the slow load times a wordpress site can have, once you also rely on multiple plugins, I've setup lightspeed cache, which have help speed up the load times. Currently I'm scoring quite good (in the 90's) on Google's page insight.

## Step 4: Writing Articles

This is where I'm at now. The articles have been identified, the site is set up and the domain has been purchased. 

No I will turn my focus to start producing some articles for the site - in stead of writing any more blog posts on this blog.

Ready-set-go!
