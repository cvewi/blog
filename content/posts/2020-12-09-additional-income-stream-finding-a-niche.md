In my previous post, I explained how I recently started to look into establishing additional streams of income. During the pandemic I've been considering how to build on my revenue streams in order to position my self with less vulnerability to the an uncertain future. 

I've been thinking quite a lot about how to proceed from here. 

## Getting my plans in place

I'm obviously influenced by my regular job and role. I work as a consultant and project manager, so naturally these skills where some of the skills I turned to when wrapping my head around what I needed to do.

I quickly scanned the marked for a suitable solution to use for organizing my work, activities and tasks. In my job I've used many different tools depending on which client I've worked for, but I saw this as an opportunity to do a mini vendor selection. I wanted a tool which was easy to use and which would be easy to scale, should I at some point have to include anybody else in my work. E.g. if I were to outsource any of my work.

I landed on [ClickUp](http://wittrup.link/clickup) (if you use my link to signup I receive a small commission), a tool that I haven't used before. It really seems to tick all the right boxes at this point. ClickUp makes it super easy to organize your work, tasks and activities. I've set up multiple lists, which can then be viewed as [kanban boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board). This makes it easy to get an overview of things you need to do and how tasks are progressing.

Once I get more familiar with ClickUp I may decide to write a more in depth review of the tool. But so far so good!

## Step 1: Identify Niche

This is something I've spend quite some time on. I've had to find a niche, which I believe I will be able to provide good content to. This is of course easier if you have a natural interest in said niche. I seem to have identified a specific niche now. I will not go into a reveal of the exact niche in this blog post, but can spill the beans a bit. I've selected a niche, which is in the area of home appliances, food and technology. 

It's something I myself is quite interested in, which should make it easier to create content. Before creating a website and purchasing a domain I needed to see if I could identify keywords and potential articles before committing to this.
