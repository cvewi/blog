First and foremost, I'm sorry for any spelling mistakes or typos you may find on this site. I very rarely spend any time on reviewing my blog posts as this is really just a place for me to dump what's on my mind. Should you find any big mistakes, please reach out to me using the contact form here: <https://www.wittrup.me/>

This page/blog/place on the interwebs serves as my place for experimenting, testing, rambling, nerding out and getting to terms with me not having the time available I once had to do all of the previously mentioned things.
